These are simply my Neovim dotfiles. I will assume that if you are interested enough to have found or asked for my Neovim dotfiles, you will know how to apply them,
so I won't cover that.

These are by no means incredibly original dotfiles, I just find them to be a pretty decent setup which I've configured ~~by stealing code~~ with inspiration from many 
other dotfiles.

## Dependencies 
The necessary dependencies for these dotfiles are the following:
- FzF (fuzzy finder, general purpose)
- NodeJS (for the Markdown preview plugin)
- Yarn (also for the Markdown preview plugin)
