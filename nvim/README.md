# About

These are simply my Neovim dotfiles. I will assume that if you are interested enough to have found or asked for my Neovim dotfiles, you will know how to use them, so I won't cover that.

# Dependencies 

The necessary dependencies for these dotfiles are the following:

- FzF (fuzzy finder, general purpose)
- NodeJS (for the Markdown preview plugin)
- Yarn (also for the Markdown preview plugin)
- TeXLive (for VimTeX)

And probably some others that I have missed.
